Retail Shelf Analytics

* Title: Retail Shelf Analytics
* Objective: To develop an  Intelligent Retail Shelf Analytics system which can accept multiple shelf images at once and generate following metrics and valuable insights:
    * Count of each SKU
    * Shelf share of each SKU
    * List of out of stock SKUs
    * Metrics related to placement of SKUs
    * Promo ans price tags displayed on the shelf
* Abstract: This project introduces the implementation of an Intelligent Retail Shelf Analytics system to generate valuable metrics and actionable insights with the purpose of making the lives of sales reps easier. It employs the application  of mainly Image processing, Computer vision and Deep learning. Impact of different architectures for object detection and object classification has been studied. Object detection module is found to produce better results using Google Object Detection API with Faster_rcnn_resnet50_coco architecture, Object classification module is found to work better with pre-trained Resnet50 architecture. Based on the output from all these modules, all the metrics and insights has been generated.
